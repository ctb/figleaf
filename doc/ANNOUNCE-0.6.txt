ANNOUNCING figleaf v0.6.

figleaf is a code coverage package for Python.  It supports simple
and configurable recording of code coverage, as well as more complex
'section'-based recording.  It's designed for programmers who want
to integrate code coverage with their tests across a large code base.

This is the first package release of figleaf.

Note that figleaf *requires* setuptools to be installed, although it
should be usable without it.

You can install figleaf with easy_install, or download this release at

    http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf-0.6.tar.gz

Documentation is included in the .tar.gz, and you can read the latest
docs online at

figleaf is available under the MIT license.  It is Copyright (C) 2006,

I would especially like to thank Iain Lowe for his contributions to this
release.
