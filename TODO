BUG: x = [ ... ] first line of multi-line list def isn't covered.

---

these modules are imported before coverage tracing starts.

for k in 'types', 'symbol', 'sre_constants', 'keyword':
    reload(sys.modules[k])

---

also, 'figleaf Lib/test/regrtest.py' doesn't abspath regrtest.

---

no 2.3; is set in 2.4?

--

docs & tests for
 - figleaf sections plugin & annotation
 - figleaf plugin

---

annotate/cover stuff; filename canonicalization?

---

does sections coverage miss out on top-level stuff??
